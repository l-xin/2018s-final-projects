## Introduction
A Simple Study on TensorFlow. Conerned about its comuptation model and implementation. 
TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments.
In recent years, machine learning has driven advances in many different fields, the success is attributed to 3 different aspects:

1. The invention of more sophisticated machine learning models

2. The availability of large datasets for tackling problems in these fields

3. The development of software platforms that enable the easy use of large amounts of computational resources for training such models on these large datasets

Tensorflow就是一种方便且功能强大的编程框架。
